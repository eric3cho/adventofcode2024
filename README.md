Journaling my progress for 2024 Advent of Code. <br />
12/2 <br />
Working in python for practice. Took some time to get the rust off and set up the repository properly but smooth sailing after that.<br />
12/6 <br />
So far, so good. Even if it takes some time to implement the solution, my approaches have all been correct. School has been occupying more time since it's the end of the quarter but hopefully in the next few days I can catch up. <br />
